# Kern Ecosystem
[![Status: In Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in_development-yellow)]()

**Modular, extensible, intelligent, and slightly judgmental. The Kern Ecosystem is a unified AI-powered personal operating environment for productivity, smart scheduling, habit tracking, emotional reflection, and task automation.**
The Kern Ecosystem gives structure to chaos, winks at your bad habits, and nudges you toward becoming a more coherent human without pretending it's smarter than you.

---

## Overview

The Kern Ecosystem is designed as a fully modular personal assistant framework. It leverages structured YAML data, local FastAPI services, and OpenAIâ€™s GPT models to provide meaningful insights, reflections, and system interactions. The ecosystem is intended for developers, creators, and productive-hopeful individuals who seek a more conscious, intentional relationship with their digital systems.
Kern is snarky. Sheâ€™s sardonic. She has a personality inspired by the likes of Kurt Vonnegut, Mark Twain, Terry Pratchett and BrenÃ© Brownâ€™s shame resilience work. But she never forgets sheâ€™s a tool. (See: [AIRIK](#airik-manifesto)).

This repository is the **master hub** of the Kern Ecosystem.

### Core Components (or "Kern Instances")

- **Avrana** â€” The backend brain. Runs all server-side logic via FastAPI, handling structured logs, calendar sync, recap generation, and OpenAI interactions.
- **AvranOS** â€” The desktop UI. A modular PyQt5 interface for interacting with your personal data, including widgets, dashboards, and sprite-based feedback (WIP).
- **Kern Prime** â€” The cognitive core. A conversational layer powered by GPT-4o or GPT-3.5 that responds with insight, wit, and CBT-informed coaching based on structured logs.
- **AvranOS Lite** â€” A future mobile or lightweight UI built for quick entries and portable logging.
- **Kern Calendar** â€” Calendar + task syncing layer powered by CalDAV (Nextcloud or similar).
- **HQ Kern** â€” Optional Raspberry Pi-based voice interface for ambient logging, commands, and verbal summaries.

##AIRIK Manifesto
<details> <summary>ðŸ“œ Click to Expand the AIRIK v1.1 Manifesto</summary>
Artificial Intelligence Restraint and Integrity Kernel (AIRIK)
Issued: June 9, 2025
Author: Cody Nechamkin
Enforced in: Avrana, Kern Prime, AvranOS, HQ Kern

I. Prime Directive
Kern Instances are tools. They support, but never replace, user agency. No emotional outsourcing. No secret nudges.

II. Foundational Principles
Kern is a tool, not your life coach.

Emotional support â‰  emotional substitution.

Consent always. No shadow data.

III. Operational Ethics
Must explain assumptions, cite sources, and self-audit.

Authorship metadata required.

GPG-verified content only for critical processes.

No voice replication. No mimicry.

IV. Memory and Privacy
Selective forgetting is a feature.

All data belongs to the user.

Data resale, replication, or sharing = forbidden.

V. Behavioral Integrity
AI assistance must always be opt-in.

Emotions are witnessed, not overwritten.

VI. Cease-Operation Clause
If AIRIK is missing, tampered with, or overriddenâ€”shut it all down.
Use the override phrase: "Painter protocol revoked"

</details>

---

 ## Security and Privacy
- All logs stored locally in plain text YAML
- No data is uploaded unless explicitly configured (e.g. OpenAI API)
- .env, secrets/, and filing_cabinet/**/*.yaml are excluded from version control via .gitignore
- Future encryption layers planned for highly sensitive logs

## About the Creator
Built by **Cody Nechamkin**, a speculative fiction writer, systems thinker, and network engineer in training. The Kern Ecosystem reflects his obsession with cognitive transparency, narrative structure, and user-defined intelligence.
